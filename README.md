# Arbitrum Grants Defense Manager (AGDM)

Arbitrum Grants Defence Manager is the ideal dashboard for efficiently managing and securing grant rounds on Arbitrum. Here's an overview of the project's main features.

## Introduction

Arbitrum Grants Defence Manager, also known as **AGDM**, is a powerful dashboard that provides grant managers with comprehensive tools for managing round statistics, detecting potential threats, and implementing advanced defence mechanisms.

## Features

### 1. Round Statistics Overview

AGDM offers grant managers a user-friendly interface for viewing and analysing round statistics. Keep track of the progress, milestones, and overall performance of each grant round at a glance.

## 2. Threat Detection and Isolation

An important aspect of AGDM is its advanced threat detection system. Grant managers can use a pre-defined detection method to identify and isolate potential threats during a round. This ensures that malicious entities, such as attack bots and recycling attacks, are quickly detected and neutralized.

### 3. Defense Capabilities.

AGDM is equipped with innovative defense capabilities that actively counter the most common bot and recycling attacks. This proactive defense mechanism improves the security status of  grant rounds by providing a strong barrier against potential threats.

### 4: Sybil Database Integration

AGDM integrates a Sybil database seamlessly to improve security. This feature improves detection accuracy by comparing potential threats to a comprehensive database of known malicious entities.
